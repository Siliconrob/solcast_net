# Solcast .NET API Client library

.NET client library for querying the Solcast API async/sync

This module allows a registered users to query the Solcast API [https://api.solcast.com.au](https://api.solcast.com.au).  You will need to register your user account to obtain an API key [https://solcast.com.au/api/register](https://solcast.com.au/api/register/).  Without an API key you will not be able to successfully obtain valid API results.

### Windows setup Solcast API Key

Setup System/User `environment variable`.  Details on advanced editing [StackOverflow superuser walkthrough](https://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10)

```
WinKey + R
```

Copy and Paste the following text to the **Open:** input text box for the Run Dialog

```
%windir%\System32\rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables
```

That will present this screen

Add a user or system `environment variable` to hold the Solcast API key.  User environment variables will only be available to your particular user, system environment variables are shared for all users on the system

After you have added the `environment variable` you will see the key listed in the current variables

**NOTE**: To reference this key you will need to reopen your shell prompt to read these variables again from the system (cmd, command.com, powershell, etc)


### Linux / mac OS

Open a terminal prompt
- mac OS: Spotlight search for `terminal`
- Linux: Open `bash`

```
nano .bash_profile
```

If you do not have nano it is simpler text editor than `vi`.  Use your package manager to download and install or use `vi`.  The preferred package manager for mac OS is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and once installed on your system you can issue similar commands to Linux `apt-get` and `yum` with the `brew` package manager.

Add the Solcast API Key to your user profile variables.

### Latitude and Longitude

- First as stated above you will need an API key to make valid API requests to the Solcast system.
- Second for all current library calls you will need a valid Lat/Lng coordinate in the [EPSG:4326](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/) format.  If you are familiar with modern web maps you most likely have used the expected format or a decimal point that expresses a position on the Earth.

Clarification as I often forget the coordinate planes of Latitude and Longitude along with bounds.

[Credits - Learner.org](http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/LongitudeIntro.html)

The Solcast API expects **West** for Longitude and **South** for Latitude to be expressed as a negative numbers

Example Locations on the Globe

Name | Latitude | Longitude
--- | --- | ---
Sydney, Australia | -33.865143 | 151.209900
Mumbai, India |â€Ž 19.228825 | 72.854118
Tokyo, Japan | 35.6895 | 139.69171
Paris, France | 48.864716 | 2.349014
Los Angeles, USA | 34.052235 | -118.243683

### Examples

#### NOTE: 
You can use standard environment variables to hold your API key and not need to pass the optional `apiKey` to the current methods

Environment variable names
```
SOLCAST_API_KEY
```

Accessible through process environment variable directly or with helper API method.
```
Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SOLCAST_API_KEY")
API.Key()
```


#### C# Async
```csharp
using solcast;

var getForecast = Power.Forecast( new Location
{
	Latitude = 32,
	Longitude = -97
});
getForecast.Wait();
var response = getForecast.Result;
```

#### C# sync
```csharp
using solcast;

var response = sync.Power.Forecast( new Location
{
	Latitude = 32,
	Longitude = -97
});
```
